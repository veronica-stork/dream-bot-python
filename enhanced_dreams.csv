2004-12-29,"I had two kids, but I had also given birth to a puppy and was now, I found, pregnant with a scorpion. This grossed me out, the thought that I was pregnant with a scorpion. I remember feeling like ""Why did this have to happen to me again??"" I was in a pavilion with some people from high school, I think like Alyssa Engle and Catherine Menard and Kelly Haas. I was with big Keith but he seemed like he was an ex-boyfriend, Shawn, I think.
There was another part where I was in NYC and somehow George Carlin was involved and I was going to Wendy's. And there was a picnic table outside with three dead stuffed animals on it. It was some sort of trick and I went to a parking garage to tell Tim Ignaffo about it.",140,0.10444444444444445
2005-05-11,"I was in school and I was waiting for Sandy to have her baby. She was going to call me when she went into labor. So I was taking a Chinese cooking class to pass the time, and we were sitting at these long cafeteria tables. The teacher put something in the oven and then one of the students said that there was a finished one already in there (like on cooking shows on TV) but then the oven started making weird noises and everyone was like WTF? But I ran out the door and ducked as the oven exploded. Keith's dad was in the hallway and I said something like, ""I heard the oven making weird noises and I was like get the fuck out of there!"" and his dad chuckled.
Then I went back to my dorm room, where some boy was living for some reason. Like he had been crashing there and I didn't notice. But he was really dirty and his breath stunk because he had been laying in my bed for days and hadn't brushed his teeth. He told me he had written some poetry or something on my computer and showed it to me. I wasn't sure what I thought about it, like I remember thinking it was pretty good but a little juvenile, like he had promise.
Then Sandy called and said that she had been in labor for ""the equivalent of two days"" and asked me to come down. So I left (little Keith and Ciara existed but I don't know where they were.) Big Keith came with me, and we went to a park, because for some reason Sandy was giving birth in a park. At first I thought the park was really crowded, but then all I saw was two burly Mexican men with mustaches sitting in ornately carved wooden chairs with high backs in the middle of a field. I was telling Keith that Sandy's sister had been up for the birth but had to leave to go to Australia. Sandy had been afraid that Jenn, the doula, would leave for Australia as well before the baby was born. Jenn reassured her that she wouldn't go to ""Eurasia"" before the baby came. (Yeah I know Australia isn't Eurasia.)
As we walked through the park, I realized it wasn't the right park. Sandy hadn't told me *which* park, I just assumed that was the one. We came upon an outdoor bazaar with tents selling mostly artifacts from Tibet-- statues of Buddha, prayer flags, etc. I think the dream ended with me trying to figure out what park Sandy was in.",440,-0.04388300999412112

2005-10-30,"Dream partially based on Jack Chick tracts. It was the apocalypse and the black plague had been revived in Europe. Big Keith and I were in Canada with the kids and I wanted to stock up on food so we could shut ourselves up and not contract it. (I love Herman Hesse... but anyway...) Nunavut and the government of Nunavut had something to do with this. I think I wanted to go there because it is isolated. I was also wearing a Sailor Moon crown thing and big Keith was like ""You know that is a sign of Baphomet, right?"" and I was like oh shit I'm going to Hell! And also I guess stockpiling food was forbidden by God because we were supposed to just trust him and so I was trying to find a loophole so I could stockpile food in case it wasn't really the apocalypse. Then Big Keith was taking some kind of hallucinogenic drug and I was really mad at him and stormed out onto a porch and there were other people there and started panicking, like how you panic when you realize you are doing something really dangerous mindlessly in a dream. I thought maybe they had the plague. Also in my dream, San Francisco was an island and covered in water, but not deep water, like just a foot or so of really warm water, but it was out in the ocean. And I said to my mom, who is a Californian originally, ""I didn't know San Francisco was an island,"" and she started acting like I was really stupid. ""It's just a *different color island*,"" she told me. I looked at the map, and, sure enough, it was pink while the rest of California was yellow.",294,0.0039186507936507945

2006-03-26,"I was being shown my greatest ""sin,"" not a sin in the usual sense... not murder or greed or envy, but a sin in the sense that perpetuating it would lead to my lonliness and unhappiness. It was my belief that others are not human in the way I am, that they don't have insecurities and that everything they do is calculated and purposeful. It is true that this has caused me a lot of mental anguish. I don't call people a lot of times because I am afraid to be rejected. When another person doesn't call, I assume it is intentional, that they do it because they view me as inferior and don't want to pursue a friendship with me. So chances at friendships slip through my fingers as I view each missed opportunity as a personal insult. I invited Masae and her kids to Keith's bday party in December, but haven't called her since. She hasn't called either. I, because I am afraid of being rejected and her, I assumed, because she decided she didn't like me. But I think I should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she feels the same way. Maybe she is insecure, too, or maybe she thinks that I dislike her for some reason, because she's older, because I am insecure about my Japanese speaking ability, etc.",226,-0.07948717948717948

He was really cocky and obnoxious and wouldn't help us get off the island. then he had sex with some girl who i knew was an adult but then he was like drawing a picture of her on a roll of paper above his bed, and there were drawings of other women he had had sex with, but in the picture she looked like a little girl and i wondered whether to tell somebody that he was a pedophile or something. Then I left and found all of these buildings, looked like a college campus, and all these people walking around, and I asked a girl what the buildings were and she said that two of them were churches, one for kinda mainline protestants and one for people who liked to holler ""amen!"" and such during service.

2008-01-12,"I went to the mall without the kids to do some shopping even though I felt uneasy about it for some reason. While I was there, there was some sort of attack or something and I pushed some button because I thought it would make it better, but it actually activated a bomb and the whole mall blew up. I was running from the fireball Hollywood-style and thinking as I ran that I should steal stuff during this crisis because that's what people do in events like this, right? They loot? I remember thinking of Hurricane katrina and I kept trying to take things as I ran--candy mostly but I kept putting it back because I felt bad about stealing.
Anyway I got out (and btw this took place in the ""mall"" but it's like ""the mall"" that is always in my dreams, not like the mall that is in real life.) and I usually walked home from the mall but in my dream I was standing with a couple other girls and they were going to take the bus, so I did too, even though I had a bad feeling about that, too. We got on and there was this guy standing in the front who was trying to be a tour guide or something but I could tell he was unstable. As I was thinking that I should get off at the next stop, he pulled out a gun and started shooting people. He hit me in my right ear twice and I fell.... tried to play dead basically and this guy in front of me covered me with something so the shooter wouldn't see me. For some reason he wanted to make sure that I specifically was dead and everybody kept telling him yes, I was. Then he (the shooter) was like ""did i really do that?"" and they stopped the bus and everybody got out. I had to run to a house nearby and I was hoping he wouldn't see me and realize I wasn't dead... I went into the house looking for help and there was a doctor there, and he kept saying there was no way I'd live, but I realized after a while that it was bullshit. I was fine.

2009-06-03,"last night, i dreamed that i was going to the movies with a bunch of friends. Before the movie started, we were all getting food, but it was like mcdonalds, not like a movie theater concession stand. i ordered a ""meal"" and then realized that i didn't need it because i already had a soda cup that got free refills (so i didn't need the drink that went with the meal). so i ordered a cheeseburger with no onions and a large fry. The girl working there seemed to know me. Some guy came up and started talking to me and asking what movie I was seeing (in the dream, I thought he was hitting on me). I told him I wasn't sure, but I thought my friends and I were seeing some movie that we'd seen already.... i can't remember what movie i said but as i was saying it, i realized that that couldn't be the one i was seeing, because it was already out on dvd.
I knew I was late, so I ran down the hallway. Chloe was with me, sort of, and we went past a lot of normal theater doors to get to our theater at the end. It looked like the wooden doors to a college lecture hall and there was a sign on the doors that said something like ""regular theater"". This was meant to distinguish it from the other theaters, which were presumably special in some way. Chloe and I went in. she promptly ran off and disappeared somewhere.
The lights were on all the way. there were seats all along the side of the room by the windows (yeah, there were windows.) It basically just looked like a college classroom. There were no seats in the middle. all my friends were, for the most part, crowded along the wall, uncomfortably close to one another. I wanted to sit next to Chris, but somebody was next to him, so I looked to the back of the room, which was significantly less crowded. in the very back was a couch, where evan and dimitri were sitting. they were sitting really close to one another but there was room on the other side of dimitri, so i sat down next to him and spread all my food out. (I lost my fries during the movie.)
the lights went down and the movie started i guess but i don't remember anything about the actual movie. in the dark, dimitri started getting cuddly. In my dream, I told myself it was because he knew Evan and I had ""broken up''. He had his head on my shoulder. He had long hair apparently and I noticed this when he took it out of a ponytail. It was bleach blonde. I touched it and it felt like straw. He shrugged his shoulders. After a while, I got up for some reason, and i saw that evan had curled up into a ball on the couch and was clearly really upset, i assumed it was because of me and dimitri. I talked to him, trying to coax him out of his funk.
I don't remember what happened because then all of a sudden we weren't watching a movie anymore, but were in some room that apparently belonged to big Keith. there was a full-length mirror in it, and I was confused about whether it was mine or his. somehow it ended up breaking and my friends and i vacuumed up the pieces. Then we left.
out in the parking lot, everyone's cars were crammed into what looked like large bookshelves. for some reason everyone had disappeared and i wasn't sure where they went, so i checked the car bookshelves to see if i recognized anybody's cars. I didn't at first, but eventually found Dimitri's red car, facing away from me, so I knew they were still there somewhere.
Keith called on the cellphone and started yelling at me for breaking the mirror. i asked him what had happened to my headphones for my ipod, and he told me that he had taken them as payment for all the things i'd broken. I was livid.
I still couldn't find my friends, and ended up wandering down the streets of one of these dream towns I have.... found my mom somehow and brought her to a pub that had a door leading to a spiral staircase. on the door, it said something about a vampire in the tower. I asked my mom if she'd ever seen the vampire and she said no. i was like, oh you have to see it, it's pretty cool. so we went in the door, climbed the staircase, and it led into a very small attic space.

She asked for something really weird and complicated, like for her drink she wanted a cafe mocha, which I guess in theory wouldn't be that hard to accomplish.... I could probably have just put chocolate syrup in coffee, but for some reason I was really confused and she started telling me in detail exactly what I had to do, how much coffee, how much milk, how much chocolate. then she wanted like, a greek salad and maybe a quesadilla or something? something else that people order a lot. then all these people started flooding in. tons of them. I couldn't keep up.

Then other waitresses started coming in, but they weren't people I knew. they were like, these really super skinny big-boobed blonde girls, really typical American beauty standards. I got the impression that Bob had hired them because he thought having really traditionally attractive women working there would increase business. I started worrying that he would fire me because I didn't look like that. I was still really confused, not sure which tables were mine and to top it off, the people I had been serving had changed tables several times. then i noticed that i hadn't even put in that woman's order yet, and had in fact not even gotten her drink.

2009-09-15,"I was back in high school and we went on a field trip to disney world. there was some guy there that Lindsay was interested in but who had rebuffed her advances. We were about to leave for home but I wanted to get food before we left, so I went to a pizza place and Rich Contini was working there. We were bullshitting a bit and I ordered two pieces of pepperoni pizza. There was a little asian girl working with him and she was giving me a hard time. i had a considerable amount of difficulty figuring out how to give her the right amount of money, and then left without my pizza and went back to rejoin the group.
We were all sitting on a dock watching boats go by. Apparently the boats were rides. Pirates of the Caribbean went by and then another boat that looked like a pirate ship but was actually a ride for something that had nothing to do with pirates. it was based on a movie but I forgot which movie. anyway i was showing people photos from my camera and they were being projected on a screen somehow and as i showed them the pictures, i realized that they were videos. I remember thinking that it was pretty cool that I had taken these old pictures in video format. one was apparently from a trip to the zoo that I went on with Lindsay and in it, a monkey had a pizza and it was stolen by an elephant. I recounted the event to the group. Everyone was laughing. Then I found another ""picture"" but that one was boring. i flipped to the next one ""if it doesn't have monkeys with pizzas in it, i'm not interested!"" I said. The guy Lindsay was interested in was sitting next to me and hitting on me and I was really getting uncomfortable. Then I saw Crystal Niet walking across the water and I was like, holy shit she's jesus! And then I saw that she was walking on a section of the pier that was partially underwater. The guy was still hitting on me (his name was 'jon jon' apparently) and he even tried to kiss me, but I stopped him. When we got up, I said something about his advances and that I wasn't comfortable with him hitting on me since my friend was interested in him. He denied trying to kiss me.
Then we all got on a train to go back. I was walking back and back and back into the train and then realized that I had forgotten a bag in Disney World somewhere. I searched frantically for it and then when I couldn't find it, started freaking out because my ipod and camera were in the bag.
Then I was back at my parents' house talking to my mom freaking out over the lost bag. my mom was like, you know it's no big deal! it's just stuff! I was ripping up papers and I smashed a glass candle holder. ""at least your friends got back safe.."" she said. ""I don't give a shit about them!"" I yelled. ""I'd let them all die if it meant I could have my camera and ipod back! I've lost EVERYTHING!!!!' My mom tsk tsked at me, and that's when I woke up.",561,0.012745181405895697
2009-09-15,"i went to this massive museum. the inside was really pristine and white, and there were giant staircases leading to different floors. the main part was very open, but there were hallways and stuff coming off of it. i got the feeling that it wasn't just used as a museum. part of it had shops in it and part had classrooms (for arlington students i guess?)
Anyway, a big group of us went to the museum. There were like 20 people, but the only ones I remember specifically are Mike Perkins, Keith Travis, Robbie Bear and Chris. We ended up getting separated almost immediately and I wandered the museum alone, eventually stumbling upon some sort of water exhibit. you would walk through a maze-like set of partitions and water squirted from different types of nozzles and there was some sort of explanation posted on plaques on the walls. I was walking through it and I came upon what looked like a dead body laying under one of the partitions, just the foot sticking out. The plaque above it detailed some sort of water-related death, and I guess it was supposed to just be a mannequin but somehow I realized that it was an actual person, and I thought they had died in the exhibit. I ran out and, after getting lost in some OTHER exhibit that involved monkeys in little cars. I found a girl that worked at the museum. I breathlessly told her that I had found a dead body in the water exhibit. ""oh,"" she laughed. ""that's just robbie bear! he volunteered to be the body in the exhibit!"" i went back and sure enough, it was robbie bear. i marveled that both the girl and i knew robbie bear, but she didn't seem to care.
Robbie Bear and I set off to find the other members of our group, but he ran really fast ahead of me and I got left behind. Part of my search involved SLIDING down these massive stairs because if I tried to walk, I would fall. FINALLY i came across mike, keith travis and a couple really ugly guys. i ran up and hugged Mike gratefully (and he didn't grumble at me!) and was like omg thank god i found you! i was all alone and robbie bear ran away from me and...andd....!!! and mike was like, it's ok we're leaving now. I asked where Chris was and Mike misunderstood me and thought I was asking where Chris was going after the museum, and he said that he was going to be ""in a hot tub up the road"" with his parents and two girls. He said that both he (mike) and I were invited and I should come. I fretted about how I would look in my bathing suit and we all left.",472,0.02573784722222222

eventually keith came there and was pissed about something but i think he calmed down. then he wanted dimitri to talk to the kids or something? so i went through the house calling his name and finally found him and then he, keith and i were walking to find the kids and dimitri was making all these smart-ass comments at keith's expense and i was all like, dimitri, you're so awesome! lol.",477,0.08029166666666668

there was another part where i was at work and they had totally revamped the diner, made it fancy. the window wasn't right out in the open, the cooks worked out of the way, down a hallway. it was basically a typical ""diner-mare"" as christine calls them: there were too many people, i couldn't get their food fast enough and everyone was getting mad at me. it was really frustrating.

The area was really sparsely populated, the only discernible landmarks being a large lake with a smaller, crystalline man-made lake contained within it and a castle.

I knew it was Montana because I had looked at the state in Google Earth and I saw a rock formation that said “Montana” in block letters on it. I then saw that same formation from the plane.
The plane went down in the desert after flying through forest and almost landing in a lake where there were children playing and trying to catch a small elephant (to eat?) I found this cruel. When the plane landed, the stewardess got off and was like fuck this shit, I’m not getting back on. The pilot keeps fucking up. She walked off into the desert. I wasn’t sure at first if I would wait and stay on the plane while he tried again to get us the rest of the way to Utah, or not. I decided not to.
It turned out that my mom was there because she was worried. She had driven all the way to Montana, which she said only took about 2 hours. I argued with her, pointing out that there are places in NY that are 2 hours away but she insisted, so I relented.
I found a hotel to stay in. The room was weirdly open to the rest of the building. People were wandering through. I went to some bar nearby and found Chris Armstrong. He had changed his last name to “Alexander” and had green eyes. He was camping in the woods nearby and would go to this bar but no further. Jp made it there somehow.
Then we were bringing my mom to some country festival. We accidentally parked where the mic was set up and people let us know but in a more friendly manner than I expected. We saw Dimitri there which was weird because a) It was a country music festival and b) we were all the way in Montana.
I somehow met up with some girls from high school, maybe Alyssa Engle? And a couple other popular girls. One had to compete in a drag race to avoid having sex with someone, maybe Chris? And she lost, which meant she got pregnant.

It was very frustrating, but I kept seeing things I wanted to go back to later with the baby. There was a floor that was a LEGO themepark, another that was an indoor playground kind of like a mix between Kids Kingdom and an adventure park, one that was a children’s museum, etc. There was also a floor that was dorms, and I realized that the apartment complex was partially a frat house.

2023-08-02,"I was at some house party with Jp, his parents, and Ronin. I could tell that I didn’t fit in, and went to sit away from everyone else on a couch to wait it out. I picked up a remote and started fiddling with it. All of a sudden, the host (who seemed to be a filmmaker) pointed at me and said “You there, with the remote! Drop it!” I was like oh, sorry, sorry. She asked me if I pushed the “call” button and I was like “No,” but I panicked worrying that maybe I did, by accident.
I was struggling trying to find my other shoe, a pink Converse, as I wanted to leave. Scrambling around on the floor and embarrassed. Finally, I found it and walked out.
Next door there was a used bookstore, which I decided to go to to pass some time. Inside, I found a book in Japanese with a title that said something like “Life is meaningless, so I am going to spend it reading books about crime.” I went up to the shop owner and asked how much it would be. He examined it and said $7.50. I realized I didn’t have my money on me, so I went out to look for my wallet.
As I left the store, a strange woman grabbed the book out of my hand. I was trying to tell her how incredibly rude that had been - I was furious - but she interrupted me and was like “This book is actually $23. It says so on the back.” I tried to tell her that since it was a used bookstore, they could charge whatever the hell they wanted. But I was distracted wondering where my wallet was. I noticed that our car was missing from the other house, and started calling Jp and Ciara in a panic. Nobody was picking up their phones. I think my parents were with them, too. I realized I was stranded.",331,-0.10281250000000001
2023-08-05,"I was involved in something with Kristin from the Millbrook library where we had a serial killer coming to my house. I was afraid that Ronin would be in danger so I locked him, crying, in a mailbox. A passerby told me that parents disgusted him, that I disgusted him for trying to protect Ronin. When the serial killer came, he was all tied up and gagged like Hannibal lecter but I was still so scared that I tripped over my own feet trying to back away from him.",89,-0.36666666666666664

2023-08-12,"I was at some big crazy Hollywood party.  For some reason I had to give John  belluci a blow job out I would be seen as rude. I was trying to clean myself up in the bathroom when Trent Reznor approached me and told me I was so bad at scrabble that he felt bad for me.  I told him that 12 year old me would be both mortified that he had noticed that, and thrilled that he had noticed me at all. I congratulated myself for not like, fainting or something.
I also dreamed that Xerda attacked Walkencat so badly that he had this big open wound on his side and I thought he would die. He went off to hide somewhere. I found him and brought him to a weird vet where they stitched him up and he seemed much better. People were selling Vietnamese food outside at some sort of festival.",154,-0.13809523809523802

I got mad and when I talked to him more he told me that he had been texting with her for a while and really liked her, she was much more fun than I was etc. I got mad and punched him until he got this big knot on his chest that looked like a dick.
Then I was out in the street and this thing came down from the sky that at first people thought was a plane but then it kind of lodged in the ground and seemed like it was going to blow up. I realized it was a bomb or something and started trying to run but there were so many people in my way and they weren’t moving fast enough. I managed to push out of the crowd and dive behind something just as it exploded. Realized it was some kind of weapon from maybe Russia and that tons of them had been deployed across the country. They had been up in orbit and somehow disguised as stars so we didn’t see them.",196,0.14027777777777778

We had also knocked down walls to find stuff hidden inside them - whole other rooms filled with shelves holding books, toys, games, etc. an old SNES. a science toy I thought ronin would like. Books in Japanese. Ronin was running all over, up and down the stairs and around the house. The second floor it seemed had belonged to a young boy and still had his bed and stuff in it. Jp wanted to sleep there overnight but I was scared, like of ghosts I think. It was still creepy and the top floor was still too full of stuff to even approach.",125,0.049826388888888885

I did look at it again, and it was actually more janky than I originally thought, so I didn’t buy it.
Then, I was looking at an AM radio marveling at how simple it was to make when I realized that my brother was standing there talking to the guy. He started crying and I stepped out.
Then, I was in our old neighborhood in Poughkeepsie near Vassar where I was showing Ronin how I used to walk from there to Vassar, and to the Arlington Library.",136,0.03863636363636363
