{"date":"2005-05-11","content":"I was in school and I was waiting for Sandy to have her baby. She was going to call me when she went into labor. So I was taking a Chinese cooking class to pass the time, and we were sitting at these long cafeteria tables. The teacher put something in the oven and then one of the students said that there was a finished one already in there (like on cooking shows on TV) but then the oven started making weird noises and everyone was like WTF? But I ran out the door and ducked as the oven exploded. Keith's dad was in the hallway and I said something like, \"I heard the oven making weird noises and I was like get the fuck out of there!\" and his dad chuckled.\nThen I went back to my dorm room, where some boy was living for some reason. Like he had been crashing there and I didn't notice. But he was really dirty and his breath stunk because he had been laying in my bed for days and hadn't brushed his teeth. He told me he had written some poetry or something on my computer and showed it to me. I wasn't sure what I thought about it, like I remember thinking it was pretty good but a little juvenile, like he had promise.\nThen Sandy called and said that she had been in labor for \"the equivalent of two days\" and asked me to come down. So I left (little Keith and Ciara existed but I don't know where they were.) Big Keith came with me, and we went to a park, because for some reason Sandy was giving birth in a park. At first I thought the park was really crowded, but then all I saw was two burly Mexican men with mustaches sitting in ornately carved wooden chairs with high backs in the middle of a field. I was telling Keith that Sandy's sister had been up for the birth but had to leave to go to Australia. Sandy had been afraid that Jenn, the doula, would leave for Australia as well before the baby was born. Jenn reassured her that she wouldn't go to \"Eurasia\" before the baby came. (Yeah I know Australia isn't Eurasia.)\nAs we walked through the park, I realized it wasn't the right park. Sandy hadn't told me *which* park, I just assumed that was the one. We came upon an outdoor bazaar with tents selling mostly artifacts from Tibet-- statues of Buddha, prayer flags, etc. I think the dream ended with me trying to figure out what park Sandy was in.","word_count":440,"sentiment":-0.04388301}

Big Keith and I were in Canada with the kids and I wanted to stock up on food so we could shut ourselves up and not contract it. (I love Herman Hesse... but anyway...) Nunavut and the government of Nunavut had something to do with this. I think I wanted to go there because it is isolated. I was also wearing a Sailor Moon crown thing and big Keith was like \"You know that is a sign of Baphomet, right?\" and I was like oh shit I'm going to Hell! And also I guess stockpiling food was forbidden by God because we were supposed to just trust him and so I was trying to find a loophole so I could stockpile food in case it wasn't really the apocalypse. Then Big Keith was taking some kind of hallucinogenic drug and I was really mad at him and stormed out onto a porch and there were other people there and started panicking, like how you panic when you realize you are doing something really dangerous mindlessly in a dream. I thought maybe they had the plague. Also in my dream, San Francisco was an island and covered in water, but not deep water, like just a foot or so of really warm water, but it was out in the ocean. And I said to my mom, who is a Californian originally, \"I didn't know San Francisco was an island,\" and she started acting like I was really stupid. \"It's just a *different color island*,\" she told me.

It is true that this has caused me a lot of mental anguish. I don't call people a lot of times because I am afraid to be rejected. When another person doesn't call, I assume it is intentional, that they do it because they view me as inferior and don't want to pursue a friendship with me. So chances at friendships slip through my fingers as I view each missed opportunity as a personal insult. I invited Masae and her kids to Keith's bday party in December, but haven't called her since. She hasn't called either. I, because I am afraid of being rejected and her, I assumed, because she decided she didn't like me. But I think I should give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she feels the same way.

Before the movie started, we were all getting food, but it was like mcdonalds, not like a movie theater concession stand. i ordered a \"meal\" and then realized that i didn't need it because i already had a soda cup that got free refills (so i didn't need the drink that went with the meal). so i ordered a cheeseburger with no onions and a large fry. The girl working there seemed to know me. Some guy came up and started talking to me and asking what movie I was seeing (in the dream, I thought he was hitting on me). I told him I wasn't sure, but I thought my friends and I were seeing some movie that we'd seen already.... i can't remember what movie i said but as i was saying it, i realized that that couldn't be the one i was seeing, because it was already out on dvd.\nI knew I was late, so I ran down the hallway. Chloe was with me, sort of, and we went past a lot of normal theater doors to get to our theater at the end. It looked like the wooden doors to a college lecture hall and there was a sign on the doors that said something like \"regular theater\". This was meant to distinguish it from the other theaters, which were presumably special in some way. Chloe and I went in. she promptly ran off and disappeared somewhere.\nThe lights were on all the way. there were seats all along the side of the room by the windows (yeah, there were windows.) It basically just looked like a college classroom. There were no seats in the middle. all my friends were, for the most part, crowded along the wall, uncomfortably close to one another. I wanted to sit next to Chris, but somebody was next to him, so I looked to the back of the room, which was significantly less crowded. in the very back was a couch, where evan and dimitri were sitting. they were sitting really close to one another but there was room on the other side of dimitri, so i sat down next to him and spread all my food out. (I lost my fries during the movie.)\nthe lights went down and the movie started i guess but i don't remember anything about the actual movie. in the dark, dimitri started getting cuddly. In my dream, I told myself it was because he knew Evan and I had \"broken up''. He had his head on my shoulder. He had long hair apparently and I noticed this when he took it out of a ponytail. It was bleach blonde. I touched it and it felt like straw. He shrugged his shoulders. After a while, I got up for some reason, and i saw that evan had curled up into a ball on the couch and was clearly really upset, i assumed it was because of me and dimitri. I talked to him, trying to coax him out of his funk.\nI don't remember what happened because then all of a sudden we weren't watching a movie anymore, but were in some room that apparently belonged to big Keith. there was a full-length mirror in it, and I was confused about whether it was mine or his. somehow it ended up breaking and my friends and i vacuumed up the pieces. Then we left.\nout in the parking lot, everyone's cars were crammed into what looked like large bookshelves. for some reason everyone had disappeared and i wasn't sure where they went, so i checked the car bookshelves to see if i recognized anybody's cars. I didn't at first, but eventually found Dimitri's red car, facing away from me, so I knew they were still there somewhere.\nKeith called on the cellphone and started yelling at me for breaking the mirror. i asked him what had happened to my headphones for my ipod, and he told me that he had taken them as payment for all the things i'd broken. I was livid.\nI still couldn't find my friends, and ended up wandering down the streets of one of these dream towns I have.... found my mom somehow and brought her to a pub that had a door leading to a spiral staircase. on the door, it said something about a vampire in the tower. I asked my mom if she'd ever seen the vampire and she said no. i was like, oh you have to see it, it's pretty cool. so we went in the door, climbed the staircase, and it led into a very small attic space.

I could probably have just put chocolate syrup in coffee, but for some reason I was really confused and she started telling me in detail exactly what I had to do, how much coffee, how much milk, how much chocolate. then she wanted like, a greek salad and maybe a quesadilla or something? something else that people order a lot. then all these people started flooding in. tons of them. I couldn't keep up.

I started worrying that he would fire me because I didn't look like that. I was still really confused, not sure which tables were mine and to top it off, the people I had been serving had changed tables several times. then i noticed that i hadn't even put in that woman's order yet, and had in fact not even gotten her drink.

{"date":"2009-09-15","content":"I was back in high school and we went on a field trip to disney world. there was some guy there that Lindsay was interested in but who had rebuffed her advances. We were about to leave for home but I wanted to get food before we left, so I went to a pizza place and Rich Contini was working there. We were bullshitting a bit and I ordered two pieces of pepperoni pizza. There was a little asian girl working with him and she was giving me a hard time. i had a considerable amount of difficulty figuring out how to give her the right amount of money, and then left without my pizza and went back to rejoin the group.\nWe were all sitting on a dock watching boats go by. Apparently the boats were rides. Pirates of the Caribbean went by and then another boat that looked like a pirate ship but was actually a ride for something that had nothing to do with pirates. it was based on a movie but I forgot which movie. anyway i was showing people photos from my camera and they were being projected on a screen somehow and as i showed them the pictures, i realized that they were videos. I remember thinking that it was pretty cool that I had taken these old pictures in video format. one was apparently from a trip to the zoo that I went on with Lindsay and in it, a monkey had a pizza and it was stolen by an elephant. I recounted the event to the group. Everyone was laughing. Then I found another \"picture\" but that one was boring. i flipped to the next one \"if it doesn't have monkeys with pizzas in it, i'm not interested!\" I said. The guy Lindsay was interested in was sitting next to me and hitting on me and I was really getting uncomfortable. Then I saw Crystal Niet walking across the water and I was like, holy shit she's jesus! And then I saw that she was walking on a section of the pier that was partially underwater. The guy was still hitting on me (his name was 'jon jon' apparently) and he even tried to kiss me, but I stopped him. When we got up, I said something about his advances and that I wasn't comfortable with him hitting on me since my friend was interested in him. He denied trying to kiss me.\nThen we all got on a train to go back. I was walking back and back and back into the train and then realized that I had forgotten a bag in Disney World somewhere. I searched frantically for it and then when I couldn't find it, started freaking out because my ipod and camera were in the bag.\nThen I was back at my parents' house talking to my mom freaking out over the lost bag. my mom was like, you know it's no big deal! it's just stuff! I was ripping up papers and I smashed a glass candle holder. \"at least your friends got back safe..\" she said. \"I don't give a shit about them!\" I yelled. \"I'd let them all die if it meant I could have my camera and ipod back! I've lost EVERYTHING!!!!' My mom tsk tsked at me, and that's when I woke up.","word_count":561,"sentiment":0.0127451814}

There were like 20 people, but the only ones I remember specifically are Mike Perkins, Keith Travis, Robbie Bear and Chris. We ended up getting separated almost immediately and I wandered the museum alone, eventually stumbling upon some sort of water exhibit. you would walk through a maze-like set of partitions and water squirted from different types of nozzles and there was some sort of explanation posted on plaques on the walls. I was walking through it and I came upon what looked like a dead body laying under one of the partitions, just the foot sticking out. The plaque above it detailed some sort of water-related death, and I guess it was supposed to just be a mannequin but somehow I realized that it was an actual person, and I thought they had died in the exhibit. I ran out and, after getting lost in some OTHER exhibit that involved monkeys in little cars. I found a girl that worked at the museum. I breathlessly told her that I had found a dead body in the water exhibit. \"oh,\" she laughed. \"that's just robbie bear! he volunteered to be the body in the exhibit!\" i went back and sure enough, it was robbie bear. i marveled that both the girl and i knew robbie bear, but she didn't seem to care.\nRobbie Bear and I set off to find the other members of our group, but he ran really fast ahead of me and I got left behind. Part of my search involved SLIDING down these massive stairs because if I tried to walk, I would fall. FINALLY i came across mike, keith travis and a couple really ugly guys. i ran up and hugged Mike gratefully (and he didn't grumble at me!) and was like omg thank god i found you! i was all alone and robbie bear ran away from me and...andd....!!! and mike was like, it's ok we're leaving now. I asked where Chris was and Mike misunderstood me and thought I was asking where Chris was going after the museum, and he said that he was going to be \"in a hot tub up the road\" with his parents and two girls. He said that both he (mike) and I were invited and I should come. I fretted about how I would look in my bathing suit and we all left.","word_count":472,"sentiment":0.0257378472}

I picked him up and brought him home and lamented that he was so ill-treated that he had walked all the way from Poughkeepsie to my parents' house in Hyde Park to find me.\nThen I was on my parents' porch, and a police chopper touched down in the yard, and I started freaking out thinking they were there to take me away for some crime I had committed unknowingly, but they just started handing out surveys. Half of the survey was already filled out. It asked if I had all these different affiliations, none of which I can remember except for Planned Parenthood. I was confused by the lack of information the surveys seemed to provide. I wondered why they bothered to come in a chopper to personally deliver these surveys that were so lacking in information.\nThen I had to go and get cat food. My parents, although they don't have a dog, had like four HUGE bags of dog food, but no cat food. So I said I'd run \"around the corner\" to 7-11 (which isn't around the corner from my parents' house; It's around the corner from Keith's house.) My mom asked me to bring Chloe with me, but then for some reason I didn't and just went alone.\nWhen I got back, I guess I had gone to the grocery store and did a full shopping trip, because I had like 10 bags of groceries. I put them down on the porch and walked in. The door was ajar and as I stepped into the house, I realized that my mom, the kids, and everyone else (there were all these other random kids in the house) were missing. I started panicking. In the dream I assumed they'd been kidnapped or hurt, not that they'd willingly gone somewhere.","word_count":335,"sentiment":-0.1068860878}

The black madonna is what Rasputin saw in the sky which led him to the historically significant portion of his life. She is seen to symbolize the more powerful, potent side of feminity. She's the badass, sexy Virgin Mary. But she's also not something I've ever really thought about all that much.

Apparently she went to school there. I realized when we got out of the car that she was super short, like toddler-height. She was kind of giving me a tour of the college and we were talking.\nThe bookstore was full of like Japanese language stuff and manga which I thought was cool. Signs were in Japanese. I wondered if it was like a school for weebs. The girl said most people were cool but not to talk to the old space guys. (Like old dudes who went back to school there to study astronomy.). I commented that I was basically an old space guy.\nWe went to some building that might have been a dorm. Inside, the girl connected with these two other girls and they were climbing around on some sort of indoor jungle gym\/bed, then laid down and were cuddling. I checked one more time to make sure the girl didn\u2019t have like a concussion, and said goodbye. I felt sad and wished I could go to school again, and that she and I could be friends.\nI thought I saw Mr Rexhouse but he had like dyed black emo dad hair and black lipstick.  I went back to the bookstore looking for Lindsay, who I guess had come there with me. She was buying a bunch of manga.","word_count":321,"sentiment":0.0867777778}

{"date":"2023-02-17","content":"had a dream that I was in that decrepit old house again, the 3-4 floor one with progressively more and more hoarded rooms as you go up the stairs. I was in an upstairs room and was contemplating whether jp and I would assume ownership of the house because it was really cool but also this huge burden that needed a lot of work, and very dangerous for the baby. Just then, a tall, kind of hulking black guy showed up with Danny DeVito. I was a little freaked out because I didn\u2019t expect to see other people there, but I asked him what he was doing there. The guy responded that he too was in line, somehow, to receive this house, because he had an ancestor who was a slave who had her likeness painted on the wall in one of the rooms on the first floor. I was like oh ok that makes sense.\nThen we realized that there was this old man there who was like, the rightful owner I guess, and he was not necessarily ready to pass the house on. I was supposed to talk to him about it and we were in a kitchen that also had like huge bookshelves in it and was kind of open and had a dumb waiter kind of thing in it that a librarian brought books up\/down in.\nThe old man told me that if he were me and jp, he would get a piece of land and build our own house to pass down to our children. I agreed that this might be the best course of action, and left. I felt a little disappointed because the house was really cool and had all kinds of treasures inside, but also it was kind of impractical to live in it with ronin because it was very unsafe. Tall stairs everywhere, moldy and falling apart things, holes in the floorboards, and of course the tremendous hoard.","word_count":327,"sentiment":0.1716398359}
